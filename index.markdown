I'm Advik Kabra, a student pursuing computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am passionate about many things, including computer science, mathematics, football, quizzing, movies, TV shows, books and learning in general. This blog is to showcase what work I've been up to, and to write about anything else I find interesting.

### My Interests
 - **Things related to my degree**: I am interested in a wide range of topics in computer science, including compilers, programming languages, data structures and algorithms, and graphics programming. I've tried my hand at projects in web development, game development, machine learning, and cybersecurity as well, and I'm always looking to explore and learn new and interesting things.
 - **Things not related to my degree**: Problems are interesting, and if there's an interesting problem (in my solving capabililty) to solve, I am glad to give it a try. I love watching movies and TV shows, and follow a bunch of them as well. I like reading books as well, and also follow football and cricket, FC Barcelona and Royal Challengers Bangalore in particular. I also like travelling and hope to do that a lot more as well. 
 > Note: I may not be good at the things I have mentioned above, and downright abysmal in some.
